# Exercise 1

1. Create a new type named `Book`.

2. For the `Book` type, define the following fields:

- isbn
- copyrightYear
- price

3. Add two endpoints to the GraphQL server. One which returns the array of books. And one which returns the first book. The endpoints (fields) should be named `books` and `book` respectively.
